Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) are formally part of the IPv6 Global Unicast address space. However, the semantics of ULAs clearly contradict the definition of "global scope". This document discusses the why the terminology employed for the specification of ULAs is problematic, along with some practical consequences of the current specification of ULAs. Finally, it formally updates RFC4291 and RFC4193 such that the scope of ULAs is defined as "local".

Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (commonly referred to as "ULAs") <xref target="RFC4193"/> are formally part of the IPv6 Global Unicast address space. However, the semantics of ULAs clearly contradict the definition of "global scope" <xref target="RFC4007"/>.</t>

<t>This document discussed the specification of ULAs and, in particular, of their associated scope. Additionally, it discusses how the semantics of ULAs contradicts their formal address scope along with some and practical consequences of this problematic definition. Finally, this document formally updates RFC4193 and RFC4291, such that ULAs are defined to have "local scope" (larger than link-local, and smaller than "global").

 <t>The problematic definition of ULAs was initially encountered when analyzing IPv6 address properties while working on <xref target="I-D.gont-v6ops-ipv6-addressing-considerations"/>.

<section title="Scope of Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses" anchor="ula-scope">


<t><xref target="RFC4193"/> formally specifies Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses. <xref target="RFC4193"/> did not formally update <xref target="RFC3513"/>, the current IPv6 Addressing Architecture at the time <xref target="RFC4193"/> was published. Therefore, ULAs were specified as a different address type, but rather as part of the Global Unicast address space.
</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3513"/> was eventually obsoleted by <xref target="RFC4291"/> (current revision of the IPv6 Addressing Architecture), but still did not formally accommodate ULAs into the IPv6 Addressing Architecture. For instance, Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC4291"/> notes that the type of an IPv6 address is identified by the high-order bits of the address, as follows:

<figure><artwork>
  Address type         Binary prefix        IPv6 notation   Section
  ------------         -------------        -------------   -------
  Unspecified          00...0  (128 bits)   ::/128          2.5.2
  Loopback             00...1  (128 bits)   ::1/128         2.5.3
  Multicast            11111111             FF00::/8        2.7
  Link-Local unicast   1111111010           FE80::/10       2.5.6
  Global Unicast       (everything else)
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>

<t>
and subsequently notes that:

<list style="hanging">
<t>"Future specifications may redefine one or more sub-ranges of the
   Global Unicast space for other purposes, but unless and until that
   happens, implementations must treat all addresses that do not start
   with any of the above-listed prefixes as Global Unicast addresses."
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Therefore,  ULAs still formally belong to the Global Unicast address space.</t>

<t>Additionally, Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC4193"/> (the specification of Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses) defines the scope of ULAs as:
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t>
  "By default, the scope of these addresses is global.  That is, they
   are not limited by ambiguity like the site-local addresses defined in
   [ADDARCH].  Rather, these prefixes are globally unique, and as such,
   their applicability is greater than site-local addresses."
</t>
</list>
</t>

<section title="Problems with the Definition of the ULA Scope" anchor="problem-ula-scope">

<t>Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC4193"/> (the specification of Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses) defines the scope of ULAs as:


<list style="hanging">
<t>
  "By default, the scope of these addresses is global.  That is, they
   are not limited by ambiguity like the site-local addresses defined in
   [ADDARCH].  Rather, these prefixes are globally unique, and as such,
   their applicability is greater than site-local addresses.  Their
   limitation is in the routability of the prefixes, which is limited to
   a site and any explicit routing agreements with other sites to
   propagate them (also see Section 4.1).  Also, unlike site-locals, a
   site may have more than one of these prefixes and use them at the
   same time."
</t>
</list>
</t>



<t>However, there is a problem in this analysis: given the birthday paradox, ULA prefixes almost guaranteed to *not* be globally unique. As such, based on the definition of "scope" and "global scope" (see <xref target="global-scope"/>), ULAs cannot possibly have a "global scope" -- their scope is certainly smaller than "global". And this non-global scope does limit the global routability of ULAs since, in principle, an address cannot be routed outside of its associated zone.

<list style="hanging">
<t>The only ULAs that could possibly have "global scope" are the so-called ULA-C <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central"/>, that have so far *not* been formally specified. </t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Practical Consequences" anchor="consequences">

<section title="Address Attributes in Programming Languages" anchor="languages">
<t>Python's ipaddress library <xref target="Python-ipaddr"/> defines 'IPv6Address' objects that have a number of attributes, including:
<list style="symbols">
<t hangText="is_private:">
'True' if the address is allocated for private networks. 
</t>
<t hangText="is_global:">
'True' if the address is allocated for public networks.
</t>
</list>

For ULAs, the is_private attribute is 'True', while the is_global attribute is 'False'. This contradicts the definition of ULAs as having "global scope" <xref target="RFC4291"/> <xref target="RFC4193"/>, but is in line with the specification update performed by this document (see <xref target="spec-updates"/>).

-->

<t>The ultimate goal is to employ coherent terminology and definitions throughout the relevant protocol specifications. Probably the only option to achieve that goal is update the definition of ULAs as having "local scope", with "local scope" defined as "larger than link-local, and smaller than global" (based on ULAs being defined as "local addresses").</t>

By default, the scope of these addresses is global.  That is, they
are not limited by ambiguity like the site-local addresses defined in
[ADDARCH].  Rather, these prefixes are globally unique, and as such,
their applicability is greater than site-local addresses.  Their
limitation is in the routability of the prefixes, which is limited to
a site and any explicit routing agreements with other sites to
propagate them (also see Section 4.1).  Also, unlike site-locals, a
site may have more than one of these prefixes and use them at the
same time.

The scope of these addresses is 'local', defined to be 'larger than 
link-local, but smaller than global'. Their limitation is in the 
routability of the prefixes, generally limited by any explicit 
routing agreements with other autonomous systems (ASes) to propagate
them, and normally limited by the Default-Free Zone (DFZ) (also see 
Section 4.1).
